                    Welcome to Ping Yo, Inc. (the "Company") Web Site (the "Site")! Your access to and use of the Site is subject to the Terms of Website Use set forth in this Agreement.
                    We only want you to apply for a loan if you’re sure you can repay it in full on your due date and still manage your other outgoings. By accepting these terms, you confirm you have provided accurate financial information and considered potential future income and outgoings in determining your ability to repay
                    We are a broker not a lender. We use a unique algorithm to connect our customers' requirements to our panel of lenders which is based on many of the features of the application details, applicant preferences, and the lenders product but does not include the commission paid by the lender to us. We DO NOT charge our customers a fee for this service. No one from Ping Yo Inc., or any financial partner relations; including lenders; will ever contact you by any means and request you to send money to them or buy products from them in advance of receiving your loan funds.

                            These Terms of Website Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Without limiting the general applicability of the arbitration provision set forth in Section 17 below, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms of Website Use shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Sussex County, Delaware and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any provisions of these Terms of Website Use shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then the provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Website Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between us with respect to the subject matter hereof.

The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute including any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Website Use are unenforceable.
                        </p><p>
                            If we have a dispute, we will submit our dispute for resolution by arbitration before the AAA in the state of Delaware. If either party files for arbitration, it will be conducted in accordance with the then current AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute including any claim related to your use of the Website, or any of our services. If either party proceeds to arbitration, each party will pay its own AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees unless the arbitrator determines that a party’s claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), in which case the party submitting such claim shall pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees. For claims brought by you of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions. The arbitrator may award any form of individual or equitable relief, including injunctive relief. Any award will be final and conclusive to the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party agrees that the arbitration proceedings and results of such proceedings shall be kept confidential. This provision shall not be construed to preclude any party from seeking injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration.
                        </p><p>
                            You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in such a suit. The Terms of Website Use do not constitute a waiver of any of your rights and remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent agreement.
