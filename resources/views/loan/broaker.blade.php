                    Quick2Lend is an online loan broker for the short-term loan, instalment loan and personal loan market. Working alongside some of the biggest direct lenders, we remove the need to search multiple different unsecured loan providers; instead, we do all the hard work for you searching a panel of more than 130 direct lenders and brokers in real time, to return a quick loan decision.
                </p><p>
                    If you need a loan for any legal purpose, then we can help. Looking for a new car loan, or perhaps you simply need some short-term cash to pay bills or an emergency loan for some other reason? Whatever your requirements, simply complete our short form and you will receive an instant online decision.
                </p><p>
                    Once you apply, our smart loan sourcing engine instantly searches 100s of short-term loan products and puts you in touch with a suitable direct lender / broker. If we are unable to source a loan for you, we may offer an alternative product such as a credit card or credit reporting product.

                    <strong>Note:</strong> No one from Quick2Lend or any financial partner will ever contact you and request you to send money or ask you to buy any products prior to receiving your loan.
                </p><p>
                    Most of our lenders will offer installment loans to consumers who have all types of FICO scores/credit backgrounds.
                </p><p>
                    Loans are typically between $250 and $3,000 and are repayable over 3 to 36 months. The longer you spread the cost of repaying loan the smaller the monthly repayments but the larger the interest you will ultimately pay.
